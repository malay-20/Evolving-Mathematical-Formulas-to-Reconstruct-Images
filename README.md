The Evolving Mathematical Formulas to Reconstruct Images project is developed for the COSC 3P71 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Brock University. This system utilizes Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically discover mathematical formulas that can reconstruct target images. Instead of using traditional pixel data storage, the image is represented by a single evolved function f(m,n) that maps normalized coordinates to grayscale intensities. The core AI logic implements a complex evolutionary search to fit patterns like geometric shapes and high-frequency textures using symbolic regression.

To install and run the project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies: NumPy for vectorized array operations, Pillow (PIL) for image loading and resizing, Matplotlib for visualizing evolution progress, and scikit-image for structural similarity metrics. These can be installed using the command: pip install numpy matplotlib pillow scikit-image.

The project is organized into a modular file structure to separate AI logic from utility functions. The main.py file serves as the entry point, managing the evolutionary loop and stagnation detection. Genetic Programming framework operations like selection and crossover are handled in ga.py, while formula.py defines the recursive tree representation of the mathematical expressions. Fitness evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) is located in fitness.py, and visualize.py provides the tools for plotting results. Target images are stored in the images/ directory, and the best formula's progress is saved every 100 generations into the evolution_steps/ folder.

To run the evolutionary process, first place your target image, such as triangle.png, into the images/ folder. Open the main.py script and edit the filename variable to match your chosen image. Then, execute the script by running python main.py in your terminal. The system will provide progress logs and save a final visual analysis as a file named results.png.

The implementation includes several advanced features designed to meet the assignment requirements. All pixel coordinates are normalized to the range [−1,1]. To maintain computational efficiency, fitness is calculated using a random sample of 400 pixels per generation. The system applies a complexity penalty to prevent "bloat" and ensure formulas remain compact. Additionally, an adaptive mutation rate is used to help the population escape local optima when progress stalls. Finally, every evolved result is compared against a random formula average and a hand-crafted linear gradient baseline.
